            BLS Hack, associated with the international Hack Club organization, is open to all students in Boston Latin School (BLS), aiming to create a diverse coding community by providing educational resources for learning to code and a platform for the global Hack Club association. We provide these resources for free thanks to the support of donors such as Tom Preston-Werner (founder of GitHub) and Elon Musk. BLS Hack offers a variety of opportunities ranging from hosting extraordinary hackathons (with a $500 Hack Club grant) that involve communities coming together to spend hours with like-minded individuals to create coding projects and grow to countless impressive digital projects and involving members in STEM and Technology internships that can help them stand out.

            Our school currently does not have a space where we can bridge the gap between coding knowledge and the application of those principles to create programs applicable in the real world. This includes creating a game on a physical gaming console, an educational and interactive web-app math game that can help calculus students, and even workshops that can be refurbished into newer ideas. These examples are all programs created by teenagers in Hack Clubs. We understand that our school is very STEM club-dense; however, we have a school of brilliant individuals but not a single open platform where everyone, regardless of expertise, gender, or affiliation, can create projects together.
