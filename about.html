                BLS Hack, associated with the international Hack Club organization, is open to all students in Boston Latin School (BLS), aiming to create a diverse coding community by providing educational resources for learning to code and a platform for the global Hack Club association. We provide these resources for free thanks to the support of donors such as Tom Preston-Werner (founder of GitHub) and Elon Musk. BLS Hack offers a variety of opportunities ranging from hosting extraordinary hackathons (with a $500 Hack Club grant) that involve communities coming together to spend hours with like-minded individuals to create coding projects and grow to countless impressive digital projects and involving members in STEM and Technology internships that can help them stand out.

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Our school currently does not have a space where we can bridge the gap between coding knowledge and the application of those principles to create programs applicable in the real world. This includes creating a game on a physical gaming console, an educational and interactive web-app math game that can help calculus students, and even workshops that can be refurbished into newer ideas. These examples are all programs created by teenagers in Hack Clubs. We understand that our school is very STEM club-dense; however, we have a school of brilliant individuals but not a single open platform where everyone, regardless of expertise, gender, or affiliation, can create projects together.

        <div class="panel reveal">
        <p>Absolutely! BLS Hack welcomes all programmers to our coding club. In fact, our community is built on the principle of inclusivity, where everyone, regardless of their experience level, is encouraged to join and grow together. We understand that starting out in coding might seem daunting, but rest assured, our club is a supportive environment that values learning and collaboration above all else. Embrace the opportunity to dive into the world of coding with us, and you'll find a wealth of resources, mentorship, and a network of like-minded individuals eager to help you embark on this exciting journey. Remember, every proficient programmer was once in your shoes, taking those first steps into the coding universe. So, don't hesitate to join us and begin your transformative coding adventure!

        <button class="accordion reveal">Do you guys actually hack?</button>
        <div class="panel reveal">
        <p>That's not the type of hacking we do. Our focus at Hack Club is harnessing the power of creativity to build innovative and impactful projects using computer science. The term "hacking" for us is about applying our programming skills to craft solutions, apps, and software that push the boundaries of what's possible.

        <button class="accordion reveal">Where and when do you guys meet?</button>
        <div class="panel reveal">
        <p>For the 2023-24 school year, we will host weekly meetings on Fridays after school from 2:45 to 3:45 PM in Dr. Nguyen's room (306).</p>
        <br></div>

        <button class="accordion reveal">Will it cost money to join?</button>
        <div class="panel reveal">
        <p>Not at all! Joining our club is completely free of charge. We firmly believe in providing an open and accessible platform for anyone passionate about coding and computer science, regardless of their financial background.

        <button class="accordion reveal">How will we code?</button>
        <div class="panel reveal">
        <p>Throughout this year, we will range through a variety of different lessons and projects, and will use a couple of web-browser-accessible coding platforms to create, edit, and publish our code. However, to keep things simple, our main coding software will be Replit, which is also used to teach the AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A courses at BLS. </p>
