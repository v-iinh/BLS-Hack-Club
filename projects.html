        <div class="panel reveal">
            <p>
                Imagine a world where you have the power to shape the landscape and design your dream buildings. 
                In this workshop, we dove into the fundamentals of 3D modeling by building our own sky islands and collaborate by merging them into a community sky village.
                Here are the results!

            <p>
                Get started making your very first game with the Sprig game engine, using JavaScript! 
                Sprig is a great tool for both beginners and advanced programmers, and if you make a game, you can get a free DIY handheld console!

            <p>
                What if instead of directing random strangers on the internet to your boring personal website, you could direct them to an entire OS - where through exploring, they get to know you?

                Let's build our own AI companion! My companion is going to be Orpheus (you might have heard of her ;) but by the end of this, you'll have your own AI best friend.

        <button class="accordion">PCB Hacker Card</button>
        <div class="panel reveal">
            <p>
                Printed Circuit Boards - PCBs - are in nearly all electronics, from phones to cars! 
                It's super easy to make your own, and make them not just functional, but also you can get creative with how they look.
                You'll design your own business card -- but with a twist -- it can transmit a URL on tap and light up! 
                You'll learn the basics of designing a PCB, and you can get the cards made for free. 
                With these skills, you'll be able to tackle even more complex boards, such as a custom macropad or fidget toy.
